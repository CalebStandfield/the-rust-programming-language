# Learning The Rust Programming Language

Why am I learning Rust? I have a couple reasons:
 - The University of Utah's robotics club uses Rust in the robots programming, thus I need to learn it, so I can contribute.
 - I plan on trying to make a Entity-Component-System (ECS) on my own for a personal project. 
 - I want to see if making a game is possible in Rust.

Learning from the book, "The Rust Programming Language".

I'm using a singular workspace, a folder with all my cargo creates inside of it.
There is a singular:
 - Cargo.lock file 
 - .gitignore
 - README.MD

Then each create and the folder has a :
 - Cargo.toml 

However, RustRover hates me and this folder setup, which is simply a folder containing many cargo crates, and will not allow me to push and pull from RustRover.
I recommend using GitHub Desktop to push and pull this repository.
